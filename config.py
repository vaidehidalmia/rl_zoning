# Training Configuration

GAMMA = 0.99            # Discount factor
CLIP_RANGE = 0.2        # PPO clipping
BATCH_SIZE = 256        # Training batch size
N_STEPS = 2048          # Steps per rollout
ENT_COEF = 0.1          # Exploration coefficient
NETWORK_ARCH = [64, 64] # Small network (prevents overfitting)

# Key Success Factors:
# 1. SPARSE REWARDS: Only task completion gives positive reward
# 2. NO INTERMEDIATE REWARDS: Eliminates all exploitation
# 3. SMALL NETWORK: Prevents overfitting on simple task
# 4. HIGH EXPLORATION: 0.1 entropy coefficient for good exploration
# 5. SUFFICIENT TRAINING: 200k timesteps for stable convergence
